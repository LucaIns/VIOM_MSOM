# VIOM_MSOM

## Simultaneous detection of VIOM and MSOM outliers using robust estimation

This MATLAB code implements the simulation study (`simMain.m`) and real-world examples (`ExMain.m`) included in the paper: 

Insolia Luca, Chiaromonte Francesca, and Riani Marco (2020),
"*A Robust Estimation Approach for Mean-Shift and Variance-Inflation Outliers*" -- SUBMITTED.

It is fully integrated with [FSDA](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/72999-fsda/).
See for instance our new `viom()` function therein.

It has been tested on MATLAB R2019b and the FSDA 2020a release.
This should work also for R users using the fsdaR package MATLAB Runtime.
